(If anyone stumbles upon this file, it's just some notes for myself because I always forgor stuff)

### Things to do before deploying...

* [ ] Update changelog (`README.md`) and commit changes
* [ ] Run `mamba activate 313` (an environment that has build deps e.g. twine)
* [ ] Run `python -m tools.deploy-release {version}`
